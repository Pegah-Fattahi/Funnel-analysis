# Funnel Analysis and Funnel Chart

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a useful funnel chart from the raw_events table data. The raw_events table captures various user events with their corresponding timestamps. While this data provides valuable insights for analysis, it is important to eliminate duplicates to avoid inflating the results. By ensuring data accuracy and selecting relevant events, we can construct a meaningful funnel chart to understand user behavior.

## Data Collection and Analysis

To build the funnel chart, the following steps were taken:
Eliminating Duplicates: A query was designed to remove duplicate events, ensuring that each event is counted only once in the funnel analysis.
Event Selection: Relevant events for the funnel analysis were identified and collected. These events were chosen based on their significance and alignment with the business objectives.
Funnel Chart Creation: A funnel chart was generated using the selected events. The chart includes a country split, providing insights into the differences between the top three countries based on the overall number of events.
Data Validation: The data and query were validated to ensure accuracy. This involved cross-referencing the results with the original dataset and conducting sanity checks.

## Challenges and Opportunities

During the analysis, several challenges and opportunities were encountered:
Data Quality: The accuracy and completeness of the raw_events table were crucial for reliable funnel analysis. Addressing any data quality issues was important to ensure the integrity of the findings.
Event Identification: Identifying the most relevant events for the funnel analysis required a deep understanding of the business context and objectives. 

## Business Questions and Insights
The funnel analysis and chart can be used to answer various business questions, such as:
Conversion Analysis: Understanding the conversion rates at each stage of the funnel can help identify bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.
User Behavior: Examining user behavior throughout the funnel can provide insights into engagement patterns, drop-off points, and potential areas for optimization.
Country Comparison: By analyzing the funnel data across different countries, it becomes possible to identify variations in user behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
